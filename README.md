# JJImageKit

## Objective-C Image Collection Viewer

Provides template classes for displaying collections of images in a UICollectionView or a UIScrollView â€” either named from the app bundle, NSURLs (lazily loaded with local file caching), or UIImages.

See SampleImageApp for an example.

The Framework is used in: [Bowman Sculpture on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/jo/app/sculpture/id572536148?mt=8)
